# Setting up Dev Env
## Installation of Vagrant, VirtualBox and Ruby
### Vagrant commands
- `vagrant up` to launch vm
- `vagrant destroy` to delete everything
- `vagrant reload` to reload any new instructions in Vagrantfile
- `vagrant halt` pauses VM  
- `vagrant` displays command options
- Let's `ssh` into our VM and launch nginx web-server
- use `apt-get` package manager in Linux - for Mac homebrew (or brew)
- to use command in `admin` use `sudo` before the command
- `sudo apt-get upgrade -y` - `-y` sets any "Do you want to do this y/n" to yes automatically
- `sudo apt-get update -y`
- `ping www.bbc.co.uk`
- to work in admin all the time(not recommended) `sudo -su` and you will land in admin mode
- We will install nginx in guest machine/VM/ubuntu 16.04
- launch default nginx page in host machine's browser
- to come out of VM `exit`
